        "method": "Log a method entry. This is a convenience method that can be used to log entry to a method. A LogRecord with message \"ENTRY\", log level FINER, and the given sourceMethod and sourceClass is logged.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

The default definition of a variable is {@code ${variableName}}. The prefix and suffix can be changed via constructors and set methods. Variable values are typically resolved from a map, but could also be resolved from system properties, or by supplying a custom variable resolver. The simplest example is to use this class to replace Java System properties. For example:  StrSubstitutor.replaceSystemProperties(\n      \"You are running with java.version = ${java.version} and os.name = ${os.name}.\");\n Typical usage of this class follows the following pattern: First an instance is created and initialized with the map that contains the values for the available variables. If a prefix and\/or suffix for variables should be used other than the default ones, the appropriate settings can be performed. After that the {@code replace()} method can be called passing in the source text for interpolation. In the returned text all variable references (as long as their values are known) will be resolved. The following example demonstrates this:  Map valuesMap = HashMap();\n valuesMap.put(\"animal\", \"quick brown fox\");\n valuesMap.put(\"target\", \"lazy dog\");\n String templateString = \"The ${animal} jumps over the ${target}.\";\n StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(valuesMap);\n String resolvedString = sub.replace(templateString);\n yielding:       The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n Also, this class allows to set a default value for unresolved variables. The default value for a variable can be appended to the variable name after the variable default value delimiter. The default value of the variable default value delimiter is ':-', as in bash and other *nix shells, as those are arguably where the default ${} delimiter set originated. The variable default value delimiter can be manually set by calling {@link #setValueDelimiterMatcher(StrMatcher)}, {@link #setValueDelimiter(char)} or {@link #setValueDelimiter(String)}. The following shows an example with variable default value settings:  Map valuesMap = HashMap();\n valuesMap.put(\"animal\", \"quick brown fox\");\n valuesMap.put(\"target\", \"lazy dog\");\n String templateString = \"The ${animal} jumps over the ${target}. ${undefined.number:-1234567890}.\";\n StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(valuesMap);\n String resolvedString = sub.replace(templateString);\n yielding:       The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 1234567890.\n In addition to this usage pattern there are some static convenience methods that cover the most common use cases. These methods can be used without the need of manually creating an instance. However if multiple replace operations are to be performed, creating and reusing an instance of this class will be more efficient. Variable replacement works in a recursive way. Thus, if a variable value contains a variable then that variable will also be replaced. Cyclic replacements are detected and will cause an exception to be thrown. Sometimes the interpolation's result must contain a variable prefix. As an example take the following source text:    The variable ${${name}} must be used.\n Here only the variable's name referred to in the text should be replaced resulting in the text (assuming that the value of the {@code name} variable is {@code x}):    The variable ${x} must be used.\n To achieve this effect there are two possibilities: Either set a different prefix and suffix for variables which do not conflict with the result text you want to produce. The other possibility is to use the escape character, by default '$'. If this character is placed before a variable reference, this reference is ignored and won't be replaced. For example:    The variable $${${name}} must be used.\n In some complex scenarios you might even want to perform substitution in the names of variables, for instance  ${jre-${java.specification.version}}\n {@code StrSubstitutor} supports this recursive substitution in variable names, but it has to be enabled explicitly by setting the {@link #setEnableSubstitutionInVariables(boolean) enableSubstitutionInVariables} property to true. This class is not thread safe."

        "method": "Log an INFO message. If the logger is currently enabled for the INFO message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

Because cookies are part of the HTTP header, and headers can only be set before the response body (html, image, etc) is sent, this method in web environments must be called before any content has been rendered. The typical approach most applications use in this scenario is to redirect the user to a different location (e.g. home page) immediately after calling this method.

It instead asks the underlying {@code SecurityManager} every time to perform the authorization check. A common misconception in using this implementation is that an EIS resource (RDBMS, etc) would be \"hit\" every time a method is called. This is not necessarily the case and is up to the implementation of the underlying {@code SecurityManager} instance. If caching of authorization data is desired (to eliminate EIS round trips and therefore improve database performance), it is considered much more elegant to let the underlying {@code SecurityManager} implementation or its delegate components manage caching, not this class. A {@code SecurityManager} is considered a business-tier component, where caching strategies are better managed. Applications from large and clustered to simple and JVM-local all benefit from stateless architectures.

A cookie's value can uniquely identify a client, so cookies are commonly used for session management. A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them. HTTP 1.0 does not cache pages that use cookies created with this class. This class does not support the cache control defined with HTTP 1.1. This class supports both the Version 0 (by Netscape) and Version 1 (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications. By default, cookies are created using Version 0 to ensure the best interoperability."

        "method": "Log a FINER message. If the logger is currently enabled for the FINER message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

A cookie's value can uniquely identify a client, so cookies are commonly used for session management. A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them. HTTP 1.0 does not cache pages that use cookies created with this class. This class does not support the cache control defined with HTTP 1.1. This class supports both the Version 0 (by Netscape) and Version 1 (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications. By default, cookies are created using Version 0 to ensure the best interoperability."

Loading from and storing to a stream delegates to Properties.load and Properties.store, respectively, to be fully compatible with the Unicode conversion as implemented by the JDK Properties class. On JDK 1.6, Properties.load\/store will also be used for readers\/writers, effectively turning this class into a plain backwards compatibility adapter. The persistence code that works with Reader\/Writer follows the JDK's parsing strategy but does not implement Unicode conversion, because the Reader\/Writer should already apply proper decoding\/encoding of characters. If you use prefer to escape unicode characters in your properties files, do not specify an encoding for a Reader\/Writer (like ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource's \"defaultEncoding\" and \"fileEncodings\" properties). As of Spring 1.2.2, this implementation also supports properties XML files, through the loadFromXml and storeToXml methods. The default implementations delegate to JDK 1.5's corresponding methods, throwing an exception if running on an older JDK.

Any character requiring encoding is encoded as {@code \\xxx} where {@code xxx} is the shortest hexidecimal representation of its Unicode code point (after decoding surrogate pairs if necessary). This encoding is never zero padded. Thus, for example, the tab character is encoded as {@code \\9}, not {@code \\0009}. The encoder looks ahead 1 character in the input and appends a space to an encoding to avoid the next character becoming part of the hexidecimal encoded sequence. Thus \u201C{@code '1}\u201D is encoded as \u201C{@code \\27 1}\u201D, and not as \u201C{@code \\271}\u201D. If a space is not necessary, it is not included, thus \u201C{@code 'x}\u201D is encoded as \u201C{@code \\27x}\u201D, and not as \u201C{@code \\27 x}\u201D.

        "method": "Log a FINEST message. If the logger is currently enabled for the FINEST message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

        "class": "An advanced hash table supporting configurable garbage collection semantics of keys and values, optional referential-equality, full concurrency of retrievals, and adjustable expected concurrency for updates. This table is designed around specific advanced use-cases. If there is any doubt whether this table is for you, you most likely should be using {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} instead. This table supports strong, weak, and soft keys and values. By default keys are weak, and values are strong. Such a configuration offers similar behavior to {@link java.util.WeakHashMap}, entries of this table are periodically removed once their corresponding keys are no longer referenced outside of this table. In other words, this table will not prevent a key from being discarded by the garbage collector. Once a key has been discarded by the collector, the corresponding entry is no longer visible to this table; however, the entry may occupy space until a future table operation decides to reclaim it. For this reason, summary functions such as {@code size} and {@code isEmpty} might return a value greater than the observed number of entries. In order to support a high level of concurrency, stale entries are only reclaimed during blocking (usually mutating) operations. Enabling soft keys allows entries in this table to remain until their space is absolutely needed by the garbage collector. This is unlike weak keys which can be reclaimed as soon as they are no longer referenced by a normal strong reference. The primary use case for soft keys is a cache, which ideally occupies memory that is not in use for as long as possible. By default, values are held using a normal strong reference. This provides the commonly desired guarantee that a value will always have at least the same life-span as it's key. For this reason, care should be taken to ensure that a value never refers, either directly or indirectly, to its key, thereby preventing reclamation. If this is unavoidable, then it is recommended to use the same reference type in use for the key. However, it should be noted that non-strong values may disappear before their corresponding key. While this table does allow the use of both strong keys and values, it is recommended to use {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} for such a configuration, since it is optimized for that case. Just like {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap}, this class obeys the same functional specification as {@link java.util.Hashtable}, and includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of {@code Hashtable}. However, even though all operations are thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking, and there is not any support for locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access. This class is fully interoperable with {@code Hashtable} in programs that rely on its thread safety but not on its synchronization details. Retrieval operations (including {@code get}) generally do not block, so may overlap with update operations (including {@code put} and {@code remove}). Retrievals reflect the results of the most recently completed update operations holding upon their onset. For aggregate operations such as {@code putAll} and {@code clear}, concurrent retrievals may reflect insertion or removal of only some entries. Similarly, Iterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the state of the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the iterator\/enumeration. They do not throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}. However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time. The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by the optional {@code concurrencyLevel} constructor argument (default {@code 16}), which is used as a hint for internal sizing. The table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention. Because placement in hash tables is essentially random, the actual concurrency will vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one is appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and all others will only read. Also, resizing this or any other kind of hash table is a relatively slow operation, so, when possible, it is a good idea to provide estimates of expected table sizes in constructors. This class and its views and iterators implement all of the optional methods of the {@link Map} and {@link Iterator} interfaces. Like {@link Hashtable} but unlike {@link HashMap}, this class does not allow {@code null} to be used as a key or value. This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework."

Why this is the case, can hardly be explained, because the {@link WebServer} is at best a workaround, compared to full blown servlet engines like Tomcat or Jetty. For example, under heavy load it will almost definitely be slower than a real servlet engine, because it does neither support proper keepalive (multiple requests per physical connection) nor chunked mode (in other words, it cannot stream requests). If you still insist in using the {@link WebServer}, it is recommended to use its subclass, the {@link ServletWebServer} instead, which offers a minimal subset of the servlet API. In other words, you keep yourself the option to migrate to a real servlet engine later. Use of the {@link WebServer} goes roughly like this: First of all, create a property file (for example \"MyHandlers.properties\") and add it to your jar file. The property keys are handler names and the property values are the handler classes. Once that is done, create an instance of WebServer:    final int port = 8088;\n   final String propertyFile = \"MyHandler.properties\";\n\n   PropertyHandlerMapping mapping = new PropertyHandlerMapping();\n   ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();\n   mapping.load(cl, propertyFile);\n   WebServer webServer = new WebServer(port);\n   XmlRpcServerConfigImpl config = new XmlRpcServerConfigImpl();\n   XmlRpcServer server = webServer.getXmlRpcServer();\n   server.setConfig(config);\n   server.setHandlerMapping(mapping);\n   webServer.start();"

In this example, the RDN consist of multiple attribute type\/value pairs. The RDN is parsed as described in the class description for {@link javax.naming.ldap.LdapName LdapName}. The Rdn class represents an RDN as attribute type\/value mappings, which can be viewed using {@link javax.naming.directory.Attributes Attributes}. In addition, it contains convenience methods that allow easy retrieval of type and value when the Rdn consist of a single type\/value pair, which is how it appears in a typical usage. It also contains helper methods that allow escaping of the unformatted attribute value and unescaping of the value formatted according to the escaping syntax defined in RFC2253. For methods that take or return attribute value as an Object, the value is either a String (in unescaped form) or a byte array. Rdn will properly parse all valid RDNs, but does not attempt to detect all possible violations when parsing invalid RDNs. It is \"generous\" in accepting invalid RDNs. The \"validity\" of a name is determined ultimately when it is supplied to an LDAP server, which may accept or reject the name based on factors such as its schema information and interoperability considerations. The following code example shows how to construct an Rdn using the constructor that takes type and value as arguments:       Rdn rdn = new Rdn(\"cn\", \"Juicy, Fruit\");\n      System.out.println(rdn.toString());\n The last line will print cn=Juicy\\, Fruit. The {@link #unescapeValue(String) unescapeValue()} method can be used to unescape the escaped comma resulting in the original value \"Juicy, Fruit\". The {@link #escapeValue(Object) escapeValue()} method adds the escape back preceding the comma. This class can be instantiated by a string representation of the RDN defined in RFC 2253 as shown in the following code example:       Rdn rdn = new Rdn(\"cn=Juicy\\\\, Fruit\");\n      System.out.println(rdn.toString());\n The last line will print cn=Juicy\\, Fruit. Concurrent multithreaded read-only access of an instance of Rdn need not be synchronized. Unless otherwise noted, the behavior of passing a null argument to a constructor or method in this class will cause NullPointerException to be thrown."

        "method": "Gets the contents of this URL. This method is a shorthand for:      openConnection().getContent()",
        "class": "Class {@code URL} represents a Uniform Resource Locator, a pointer to a \"resource\" on the World Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a directory, or it can be a reference to a more complicated object, such as a query to a database or to a search engine. More information on the types of URLs and their formats can be found at: Types of URL In general, a URL can be broken into several parts. Consider the following example:      http:\/\/www.example.com\/docs\/resource1.html\n The URL above indicates that the protocol to use is {@code http} (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and that the information resides on a host machine named {@code www.example.com}. The information on that host machine is named {@code \/docs\/resource1.html}. The exact meaning of this name on the host machine is both protocol dependent and host dependent. The information normally resides in a file, but it could be generated on the fly. This component of the URL is called the path component. A URL can optionally specify a \"port\", which is the port number to which the TCP connection is made on the remote host machine. If the port is not specified, the default port for the protocol is used instead. For example, the default port for {@code http} is {@code 80}. An alternative port could be specified as:      http:\/\/www.example.com:1080\/docs\/resource1.html\n The syntax of {@code URL} is defined by RFC 2396: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, amended by RFC 2732: Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs. The Literal IPv6 address format also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described here. A URL may have appended to it a \"fragment\", also known as a \"ref\" or a \"reference\". The fragment is indicated by the sharp sign character \"#\" followed by more characters. For example,      http:\/\/java.sun.com\/index.html#chapter1\n This fragment is not technically part of the URL. Rather, it indicates that after the specified resource is retrieved, the application is specifically interested in that part of the document that has the tag {@code chapter1} attached to it. The meaning of a tag is resource specific. An application can also specify a \"relative URL\", which contains only enough information to reach the resource relative to another URL. Relative URLs are frequently used within HTML pages. For example, if the contents of the URL:      http:\/\/java.sun.com\/index.html\n contained within it the relative URL:      FAQ.html\n it would be a shorthand for:      http:\/\/java.sun.com\/FAQ.html\n The relative URL need not specify all the components of a URL. If the protocol, host name, or port number is missing, the value is inherited from the fully specified URL. The file component must be specified. The optional fragment is not inherited. The URL class does not itself encode or decode any URL components according to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. It is the responsibility of the caller to encode any fields, which need to be escaped prior to calling URL, and also to decode any escaped fields, that are returned from URL. Furthermore, because URL has no knowledge of URL escaping, it does not recognise equivalence between the encoded or decoded form of the same URL. For example, the two URLs:     http:\/\/foo.com\/hello world\/ and http:\/\/foo.com\/hello%20world would be considered not equal to each other. Note, the {@link java.net.URI} class does perform escaping of its component fields in certain circumstances. The recommended way to manage the encoding and decoding of URLs is to use {@link java.net.URI}, and to convert between these two classes using {@link #toURI()} and {@link URI#toURL()}. The {@link URLEncoder} and {@link URLDecoder} classes can also be used, but only for HTML form encoding, which is not the same as the encoding scheme defined in RFC2396."

        "method": "Log a FINE message. If the logger is currently enabled for the FINE message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

If no matching method is found by step 1 then: If C is a class other than {@code Object}, then this algorithm is invoked recursively on the superclass of C.

A cookie's value can uniquely identify a client, so cookies are commonly used for session management. A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them. HTTP 1.0 does not cache pages that use cookies created with this class. This class does not support the cache control defined with HTTP 1.1. This class supports both the Version 0 (by Netscape) and Version 1 (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications. By default, cookies are created using Version 0 to ensure the best interoperability."

This can be attached at either end of a data-pipeline to help satisfy Postel's principle: be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others Applied to JSON-like content from others, it will produce well-formed JSON that should satisfy any parser you use. Applied to your output before you send, it will coerce minor mistakes in encoding and make it easier to embed your JSON in HTML and XML. Input The sanitizer takes JSON like content, and interprets it as JS eval would. Specifically, it deals with these non-standard constructs. {@code '...'} Single quoted strings are converted to JSON strings. {@code \\xAB} Hex escapes are converted to JSON unicode escapes. {@code \\012} Octal escapes are converted to JSON unicode escapes. {@code 0xAB} Hex integer literals are converted to JSON decimal numbers. {@code 012} Octal integer literals are converted to JSON decimal numbers. {@code +.5} Decimal numbers are coerced to JSON's stricter format. {@code [0,,2]} Elisions in arrays are filled with {@code null}. {@code [1,2,3,]} Trailing commas are removed. {foo:\"bar\"} Unquoted property names are quoted. \/\/comments JS style line and block comments are removed. (...) Grouping parentheses are removed. The sanitizer fixes missing punctuation, end quotes, and mismatched or missing close brackets. If an input contains only white-space then the valid JSON string {@code null} is substituted. Output The output is well-formed JSON as defined by RFC 4627. The output satisfies three additional properties: The output will not contain the substring (case-insensitively) {@code \"The output will not contain the substring {@code \"]]>\"} so can be embedded inside an XML CDATA section without further encoding. The output is a valid Javascript expression, so can be parsed by Javascript's eval builtin (after being wrapped in parentheses) or by JSON.parse. Specifically, the output will not contain any string literals with embedded JS newlines (U+2028 Paragraph separator or U+2029 Line separator). The output contains only valid Unicode scalar values (no isolated UTF-16 surrogates) that are allowed in XML unescaped. Security Since the output is well-formed JSON, passing it to eval will have no side-effects and no free variables, so is neither a code-injection vector, nor a vector for exfiltration of secrets. This library only ensures that the JSON string → Javascript object phase has no side effects and resolves no free variables, and cannot control how other client side code later interprets the resulting Javascript object. So if client-side code takes a part of the parsed data that is controlled by an attacker and passes it back through a powerful interpreter like {@code eval} or {@code innerHTML} then that client-side code might suffer unintended side-effects. Efficiency The sanitize method will return the input string without allocating a new buffer when the input is already valid JSON that satisfies the properties above. Thus, if used on input that is usually well formed, it has minimal memory overhead. The sanitize method takes O(n) time where n is the length in UTF-16 code-units."

Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the {@link java.lang.Character Character} class. The Java language provides special support for the string concatenation operator ( + ), and for conversion of other objects to strings. String concatenation is implemented through the {@code StringBuilder}(or {@code StringBuffer}) class and its {@code append} method. String conversions are implemented through the method {@code toString}, defined by {@code Object} and inherited by all classes in Java. For additional information on string concatenation and conversion, see Gosling, Joy, and Steele, The Java Language Specification. Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown. A {@code String} represents a string in the UTF-16 format in which supplementary characters are represented by surrogate pairs (see the section Unicode Character Representations in the {@code Character} class for more information). Index values refer to {@code char} code units, so a supplementary character uses two positions in a {@code String}. The {@code String} class provides methods for dealing with Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those for dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., {@code char} values)."

This encoding is not intended to be used standalone. The output should be encoded to the target context. For example: {@code ...}. (Note, the single-quote character ({@code '}) is not encoded.)

Index values refer to {@code char} code units, so a supplementary character uses two positions in a {@code String}. The {@code String} class provides methods for dealing with Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those for dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., {@code char} values)."

        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

Essentially this means that {@code Requisite} and {@code Sufficient} semantics are ignored for this method. This guarantees that proper cleanup and state restoration can take place.",
        "class": "The {@code LoginContext} class describes the basic methods used to authenticate Subjects and provides a way to develop an application independent of the underlying authentication technology. A {@code Configuration} specifies the authentication technology, or {@code LoginModule}, to be used with a particular application. Different LoginModules can be plugged in under an application without requiring any modifications to the application itself. In addition to supporting pluggable authentication, this class also supports the notion of stacked authentication. Applications may be configured to use more than one LoginModule. For example, one could configure both a Kerberos LoginModule and a smart card LoginModule under an application. A typical caller instantiates a LoginContext with a name and a {@code CallbackHandler}. LoginContext uses the name as the index into a Configuration to determine which LoginModules should be used, and which ones must succeed in order for the overall authentication to succeed. The {@code CallbackHandler} is passed to the underlying LoginModules so they may communicate and interact with users (prompting for a username and password via a graphical user interface, for example). Once the caller has instantiated a LoginContext, it invokes the {@code login} method to authenticate a {@code Subject}. The {@code login} method invokes the configured modules to perform their respective types of authentication (username\/password, smart card pin verification, etc.). Note that the LoginModules will not attempt authentication retries nor introduce delays if the authentication fails. Such tasks belong to the LoginContext caller. If the {@code login} method returns without throwing an exception, then the overall authentication succeeded. The caller can then retrieve the newly authenticated Subject by invoking the {@code getSubject} method. Principals and Credentials associated with the Subject may be retrieved by invoking the Subject's respective {@code getPrincipals}, {@code getPublicCredentials}, and {@code getPrivateCredentials} methods. To logout the Subject, the caller calls the {@code logout} method. As with the {@code login} method, this {@code logout} method invokes the {@code logout} method for the configured modules. A LoginContext should not be used to authenticate more than one Subject. A separate LoginContext should be used to authenticate each different Subject. The following documentation applies to all LoginContext constructors: {@code Subject} If the constructor has a Subject input parameter, the LoginContext uses the caller-specified Subject object. If the caller specifies a {@code null} Subject and a {@code null} value is permitted, the LoginContext instantiates a new Subject. If the constructor does not have a Subject input parameter, the LoginContext instantiates a new Subject. {@code Configuration} If the constructor has a Configuration input parameter and the caller specifies a non-null Configuration, the LoginContext uses the caller-specified Configuration. If the constructor does not have a Configuration input parameter, or if the caller specifies a {@code null} Configuration object, the constructor uses the following call to get the installed Configuration:       config = Configuration.getConfiguration();\n For both cases, the name argument given to the constructor is passed to the {@code Configuration.getAppConfigurationEntry} method. If the Configuration has no entries for the specified name, then the {@code LoginContext} calls {@code getAppConfigurationEntry} with the name, \"other\" (the default entry name). If there is no entry for \"other\", then a {@code LoginException} is thrown. When LoginContext uses the installed Configuration, the caller requires the createLoginContext.name and possibly createLoginContext.other AuthPermissions. Furthermore, the LoginContext will invoke configured modules from within an {@code AccessController.doPrivileged} call so that modules that perform security-sensitive tasks (such as connecting to remote hosts, and updating the Subject) will require the respective permissions, but the callers of the LoginContext will not require those permissions. When LoginContext uses a caller-specified Configuration, the caller does not require any createLoginContext AuthPermission. The LoginContext saves the {@code AccessControlContext} for the caller, and invokes the configured modules from within an {@code AccessController.doPrivileged} call constrained by that context. This means the caller context (stored when the LoginContext was created) must have sufficient permissions to perform any security-sensitive tasks that the modules may perform. {@code CallbackHandler} If the constructor has a CallbackHandler input parameter, the LoginContext uses the caller-specified CallbackHandler object. If the constructor does not have a CallbackHandler input parameter, or if the caller specifies a {@code null} CallbackHandler object (and a {@code null} value is permitted), the LoginContext queries the {@code auth.login.defaultCallbackHandler} security property for the fully qualified class name of a default handler implementation. If the security property is not set, then the underlying modules will not have a CallbackHandler for use in communicating with users. The caller thus assumes that the configured modules have alternative means for authenticating the user. When the LoginContext uses the installed Configuration (instead of a caller-specified Configuration, see above), then this LoginContext must wrap any caller-specified or default CallbackHandler implementation in a new CallbackHandler implementation whose {@code handle} method implementation invokes the specified CallbackHandler's {@code handle} method in a {@code java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged} call constrained by the caller's current {@code AccessControlContext}."

        "class": "An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames. User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent pathname strings to name files and directories. This class presents an abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An abstract pathname has two components: An optional system-dependent prefix string, such as a disk-drive specifier, \"\/\" for the UNIX root directory, or \"\\\\\\\\\" for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and A sequence of zero or more string names. The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname. Each subsequent name in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote either a directory or a file. The empty abstract pathname has no prefix and an empty name sequence. The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of the default separator character. The default name-separator character is defined by the system property file.separator, and is made available in the public static fields {@link #separator} and {@link #separatorChar} of this class. When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system. A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either absolute or relative. An absolute pathname is complete in that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it denotes. A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of information taken from some other pathname. By default the classes in the java.io package always resolve relative pathnames against the current user directory. This directory is named by the system property user.dir, and is typically the directory in which the Java virtual machine was invoked. The parent of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking the {@link #getParent} method of this class and consists of the pathname's prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last. Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any File object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's absolute pathname. For example, the directory denoted by the abstract pathname \"\/usr\" is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the pathname \"\/usr\/local\/bin\". The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms, and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms, as follows: For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always \"\/\". Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname denoting the root directory has the prefix \"\/\" and an empty name sequence. For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive specifier consists of the drive letter followed by \":\" and possibly followed by \"\\\\\" if the pathname is absolute. The prefix of a UNC pathname is \"\\\\\\\\\"; the hostname and the share name are the first two names in the name sequence. A relative pathname that does not specify a drive has no prefix. Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system object such as a file or a directory. If it does denote such an object then that object resides in a partition. A partition is an operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system. A single storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may contain multiple partitions. The object, if any, will reside on the partition named by some ancestor of the absolute form of this pathname. A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing. These restrictions are collectively known as access permissions. The file system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object. For example, one set may apply to the object's owner, and another may apply to all other users. The access permissions on an object may cause some methods in this class to fail. Instances of the File class are immutable; that is, once created, the abstract pathname represented by a File object will never change. Interoperability with {@code java.nio.file} package The {@code java.nio.file} package defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access files, file attributes, and file systems. This API may be used to overcome many of the limitations of the {@code java.io.File} class. The {@link #toPath toPath} method may be used to obtain a {@link Path} that uses the abstract path represented by a {@code File} object to locate a file. The resulting {@code Path} may be used with the {@link java.nio.file.Files} class to provide more efficient and extensive access to additional file operations, file attributes, and I\/O exceptions to help diagnose errors when an operation on a file fails."

        "method": "Log a WARNING message. If the logger is currently enabled for the WARNING message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

The special characters \"{@code .}\", \"{@code -}\", \"{@code *}\", and \"{@code _}\" remain the same. The space character \" \" is converted into a plus sign \"{@code +}\". All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string \"{@code %xy}\", where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However, for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified, then the default encoding of the platform is used. For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string \"The string ü@foo-bar\" would get converted to \"The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar\" because in UTF-8 the character ü is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex)."

The primitive Java types ({@code boolean}, {@code byte}, {@code char}, {@code short}, {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float}, and {@code double}), and the keyword {@code void} are also represented as {@code Class} objects. {@code Class} has no public constructor. Instead {@code Class} objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine as classes are loaded and by calls to the {@code defineClass} method in the class loader.

        "method": "Returns the absolute form of this abstract pathname. Equivalent to new File(this.{@link #getAbsolutePath}).",
        "class": "An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames. User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent pathname strings to name files and directories. This class presents an abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An abstract pathname has two components: An optional system-dependent prefix string, such as a disk-drive specifier, \"\/\" for the UNIX root directory, or \"\\\\\\\\\" for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and A sequence of zero or more string names. The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname. Each subsequent name in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote either a directory or a file. The empty abstract pathname has no prefix and an empty name sequence. The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of the default separator character. The default name-separator character is defined by the system property file.separator, and is made available in the public static fields {@link #separator} and {@link #separatorChar} of this class. When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system. A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either absolute or relative. An absolute pathname is complete in that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it denotes. A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of information taken from some other pathname. By default the classes in the java.io package always resolve relative pathnames against the current user directory. This directory is named by the system property user.dir, and is typically the directory in which the Java virtual machine was invoked. The parent of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking the {@link #getParent} method of this class and consists of the pathname's prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last. Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any File object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's absolute pathname. For example, the directory denoted by the abstract pathname \"\/usr\" is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the pathname \"\/usr\/local\/bin\". The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms, and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms, as follows: For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always \"\/\". Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname denoting the root directory has the prefix \"\/\" and an empty name sequence. For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive specifier consists of the drive letter followed by \":\" and possibly followed by \"\\\\\" if the pathname is absolute. The prefix of a UNC pathname is \"\\\\\\\\\"; the hostname and the share name are the first two names in the name sequence. A relative pathname that does not specify a drive has no prefix. Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system object such as a file or a directory. If it does denote such an object then that object resides in a partition. A partition is an operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system. A single storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may contain multiple partitions. The object, if any, will reside on the partition named by some ancestor of the absolute form of this pathname. A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing. These restrictions are collectively known as access permissions. The file system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object. For example, one set may apply to the object's owner, and another may apply to all other users. The access permissions on an object may cause some methods in this class to fail. Instances of the File class are immutable; that is, once created, the abstract pathname represented by a File object will never change. Interoperability with {@code java.nio.file} package The {@code java.nio.file} package defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access files, file attributes, and file systems. This API may be used to overcome many of the limitations of the {@code java.io.File} class. The {@link #toPath toPath} method may be used to obtain a {@link Path} that uses the abstract path represented by a {@code File} object to locate a file. The resulting {@code Path} may be used with the {@link java.nio.file.Files} class to provide more efficient and extensive access to additional file operations, file attributes, and I\/O exceptions to help diagnose errors when an operation on a file fails."

A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them.

        "class": "JTextComponent is the base class for swing text components. It tries to be compatible with the java.awt.TextComponent class where it can reasonably do so. Also provided are other services for additional flexibility (beyond the pluggable UI and bean support). You can find information on how to use the functionality this class provides in General Rules for Using Text Components, a section in The Java Tutorial. Caret Changes The caret is a pluggable object in swing text components. Notification of changes to the caret position and the selection are sent to implementations of the CaretListener interface that have been registered with the text component. The UI will install a default caret unless a customized caret has been set. By default the caret tracks all the document changes performed on the Event Dispatching Thread and updates it's position accordingly if an insertion occurs before or at the caret position or a removal occurs before the caret position. DefaultCaret tries to make itself visible which may lead to scrolling of a text component within JScrollPane. The default caret behavior can be changed by the {@link DefaultCaret#setUpdatePolicy} method. Note: Non-editable text components also have a caret though it may not be painted. Commands Text components provide a number of commands that can be used to manipulate the component. This is essentially the way that the component expresses its capabilities. These are expressed in terms of the swing Action interface, using the TextAction implementation. The set of commands supported by the text component can be found with the {@link #getActions} method. These actions can be bound to key events, fired from buttons, etc. Text Input The text components support flexible and internationalized text input, using keymaps and the input method framework, while maintaining compatibility with the AWT listener model. A {@link javax.swing.text.Keymap} lets an application bind key strokes to actions. In order to allow keymaps to be shared across multiple text components, they can use actions that extend TextAction. TextAction can determine which JTextComponent most recently has or had focus and therefore is the subject of the action (In the case that the ActionEvent sent to the action doesn't contain the target text component as its source). The input method framework lets text components interact with input methods, separate software components that preprocess events to let users enter thousands of different characters using keyboards with far fewer keys. JTextComponent is an active client of the framework, so it implements the preferred user interface for interacting with input methods. As a consequence, some key events do not reach the text component because they are handled by an input method, and some text input reaches the text component as committed text within an {@link java.awt.event.InputMethodEvent} instead of as a key event. The complete text input is the combination of the characters in keyTyped key events and committed text in input method events. The AWT listener model lets applications attach event listeners to components in order to bind events to actions. Swing encourages the use of keymaps instead of listeners, but maintains compatibility with listeners by giving the listeners a chance to steal an event by consuming it. Keyboard event and input method events are handled in the following stages, with each stage capable of consuming the event: Stage KeyEvent InputMethodEvent 1. input methods (generated here) 2. focus manager 3. registered key listeners registered input method listeners 4. input method handling in JTextComponent 5. keymap handling using the current keymap 6. keyboard handling in JComponent (e.g. accelerators, component navigation, etc.) To maintain compatibility with applications that listen to key events but are not aware of input method events, the input method handling in stage 4 provides a compatibility mode for components that do not process input method events. For these components, the committed text is converted to keyTyped key events and processed in the key event pipeline starting at stage 3 instead of in the input method event pipeline. By default the component will create a keymap (named DEFAULT_KEYMAP) that is shared by all JTextComponent instances as the default keymap. Typically a look-and-feel implementation will install a different keymap that resolves to the default keymap for those bindings not found in the different keymap. The minimal bindings include: inserting content into the editor for the printable keys. removing content with the backspace and del keys. caret movement forward and backward Model\/View Split The text components have a model-view split. A text component pulls together the objects used to represent the model, view, and controller. The text document model may be shared by other views which act as observers of the model (e.g. a document may be shared by multiple components). The model is defined by the {@link Document} interface. This is intended to provide a flexible text storage mechanism that tracks change during edits and can be extended to more sophisticated models. The model interfaces are meant to capture the capabilities of expression given by SGML, a system used to express a wide variety of content. Each modification to the document causes notification of the details of the change to be sent to all observers in the form of a {@link DocumentEvent} which allows the views to stay up to date with the model. This event is sent to observers that have implemented the {@link DocumentListener} interface and registered interest with the model being observed. Location Information The capability of determining the location of text in the view is provided. There are two methods, {@link #modelToView} and {@link #viewToModel} for determining this information. Undo\/Redo support Support for an edit history mechanism is provided to allow undo\/redo operations. The text component does not itself provide the history buffer by default, but does provide the UndoableEdit records that can be used in conjunction with a history buffer to provide the undo\/redo support. The support is provided by the Document model, which allows one to attach UndoableEditListener implementations. Thread Safety The swing text components provide some support of thread safe operations. Because of the high level of configurability of the text components, it is possible to circumvent the protection provided. The protection primarily comes from the model, so the documentation of AbstractDocument describes the assumptions of the protection provided. The methods that are safe to call asynchronously are marked with comments. Newlines For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see DefaultEditorKit. Printing support Several {@link #print print} methods are provided for basic document printing. If more advanced printing is needed, use the {@link #getPrintable} method. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeans™ has been added to the java.beans package. Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}."

        "class": "A simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions. A Scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern, which by default matches whitespace. The resulting tokens may then be converted into values of different types using the various next methods. For example, this code allows a user to read a number from System.in: {@code\n     Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n     int i = sc.nextInt();\n } As another example, this code allows long types to be assigned from entries in a file myNumbers: {@code\n      Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(\"myNumbers\"));\n      while (sc.hasNextLong()) {\n          long aLong = sc.nextLong();\n      }\n } The scanner can also use delimiters other than whitespace. This example reads several items in from a string: {@code\n     String input = \"1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish\";\n     Scanner s = new Scanner(input).useDelimiter(\"\\\\s*fish\\\\s*\");\n     System.out.println(s.nextInt());\n     System.out.println(s.nextInt());\n     System.out.println(s.next());\n     System.out.println(s.next());\n     s.close();\n } prints the following output: {@code\n     1\n     2\n     red\n     blue\n } The same output can be generated with this code, which uses a regular expression to parse all four tokens at once: {@code\n     String input = \"1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish\";\n     Scanner s = new Scanner(input);\n     s.findInLine(\"(\\\\d+) fish (\\\\d+) fish (\\\\w+) fish (\\\\w+)\");\n     MatchResult result = s.match();\n     for (int i=1; i<=result.groupCount(); i++)\n         System.out.println(result.group(i));\n     s.close();\n } The default whitespace delimiter used by a scanner is as recognized by {@link java.lang.Character}.{@link java.lang.Character#isWhitespace(char) isWhitespace}. The {@link #reset} method will reset the value of the scanner's delimiter to the default whitespace delimiter regardless of whether it was previously changed. A scanning operation may block waiting for input. The {@link #next} and {@link #hasNext} methods and their primitive-type companion methods (such as {@link #nextInt} and {@link #hasNextInt}) first skip any input that matches the delimiter pattern, and then attempt to return the next token. Both hasNext and next methods may block waiting for further input. Whether a hasNext method blocks has no connection to whether or not its associated next method will block. The {@link #findInLine}, {@link #findWithinHorizon}, and {@link #skip} methods operate independently of the delimiter pattern. These methods will attempt to match the specified pattern with no regard to delimiters in the input and thus can be used in special circumstances where delimiters are not relevant. These methods may block waiting for more input. When a scanner throws an {@link InputMismatchException}, the scanner will not pass the token that caused the exception, so that it may be retrieved or skipped via some other method. Depending upon the type of delimiting pattern, empty tokens may be returned. For example, the pattern \"\\\\s+\" will return no empty tokens since it matches multiple instances of the delimiter. The delimiting pattern \"\\\\s\" could return empty tokens since it only passes one space at a time. A scanner can read text from any object which implements the {@link java.lang.Readable} interface. If an invocation of the underlying readable's {@link java.lang.Readable#read} method throws an {@link java.io.IOException} then the scanner assumes that the end of the input has been reached. The most recent IOException thrown by the underlying readable can be retrieved via the {@link #ioException} method. When a Scanner is closed, it will close its input source if the source implements the {@link java.io.Closeable} interface. A Scanner is not safe for multithreaded use without external synchronization. Unless otherwise mentioned, passing a null parameter into any method of a Scanner will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown. A scanner will default to interpreting numbers as decimal unless a different radix has been set by using the {@link #useRadix} method. The {@link #reset} method will reset the value of the scanner's radix to 10 regardless of whether it was previously changed. Localized numbers An instance of this class is capable of scanning numbers in the standard formats as well as in the formats of the scanner's locale. A scanner's initial locale is the value returned by the {@link java.util.Locale#getDefault(Locale.Category) Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT)} method; it may be changed via the {@link #useLocale} method. The {@link #reset} method will reset the value of the scanner's locale to the initial locale regardless of whether it was previously changed. The localized formats are defined in terms of the following parameters, which for a particular locale are taken from that locale's {@link java.text.DecimalFormat DecimalFormat} object, df, and its and {@link java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols DecimalFormatSymbols} object, dfs. LocalGroupSeparator The character used to separate thousands groups, i.e., dfs.{@link java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols#getGroupingSeparator getGroupingSeparator()} LocalDecimalSeparator The character used for the decimal point, i.e., dfs.{@link java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols#getDecimalSeparator getDecimalSeparator()} LocalPositivePrefix The string that appears before a positive number (may be empty), i.e., df.{@link java.text.DecimalFormat#getPositivePrefix getPositivePrefix()} LocalPositiveSuffix The string that appears after a positive number (may be empty), i.e., df.{@link java.text.DecimalFormat#getPositiveSuffix getPositiveSuffix()} LocalNegativePrefix The string that appears before a negative number (may be empty), i.e., df.{@link java.text.DecimalFormat#getNegativePrefix getNegativePrefix()} LocalNegativeSuffix The string that appears after a negative number (may be empty), i.e., df.{@link java.text.DecimalFormat#getNegativeSuffix getNegativeSuffix()} LocalNaN The string that represents not-a-number for floating-point values, i.e., dfs.{@link java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols#getNaN getNaN()} LocalInfinity The string that represents infinity for floating-point values, i.e., dfs.{@link java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols#getInfinity getInfinity()} Number syntax The strings that can be parsed as numbers by an instance of this class are specified in terms of the following regular-expression grammar, where Rmax is the highest digit in the radix being used (for example, Rmax is 9 in base 10).

If a test class is annotated with {@code @Transactional}, each test method within that class hierarchy will be run within a transaction. Test methods that are not annotated with {@code @Transactional} (at the class or method level) will not be run within a transaction. Furthermore, tests that are annotated with {@code @Transactional} but have the {@link org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional#propagation propagation} type set to {@link org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Propagation#NOT_SUPPORTED NOT_SUPPORTED} will not be run within a transaction. Declarative Rollback and Commit Behavior By default, test transactions will be automatically rolled back after completion of the test; however, transactional commit and rollback behavior can be configured declaratively via the {@link Commit @Commit} and {@link Rollback @Rollback} annotations at the class level and at the method level. Programmatic Transaction Management As of Spring Framework 4.1, it is possible to interact with test-managed transactions programmatically via the static methods in {@link TestTransaction}. {@code TestTransaction} may be used within test methods, before methods, and after methods. Executing Code outside of a Transaction When executing transactional tests, it is sometimes useful to be able to execute certain set up or tear down code outside of a transaction. {@code TransactionalTestExecutionListener} provides such support for methods annotated with {@link BeforeTransaction @BeforeTransaction} or {@link AfterTransaction @AfterTransaction}. As of Spring Framework 4.3, {@code @BeforeTransaction} and {@code @AfterTransaction} may also be declared on Java 8 based interface default methods. Configuring a Transaction Manager {@code TransactionalTestExecutionListener} expects a {@link PlatformTransactionManager} bean to be defined in the Spring {@code ApplicationContext} for the test. In case there are multiple instances of {@code PlatformTransactionManager} within the test's {@code ApplicationContext}, a qualifier may be declared via {@link org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional @Transactional} (e.g., {@code @Transactional(\"myTxMgr\")} or {@code @Transactional(transactionManger = \"myTxMgr\")}, or {@link org.springframework.transaction.annotation.TransactionManagementConfigurer TransactionManagementConfigurer} can be implemented by an {@link org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration @Configuration} class. See {@link TestContextTransactionUtils#retrieveTransactionManager} for details on the algorithm used to look up a transaction manager in the test's {@code ApplicationContext}."

Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them.

        "method": "Replaces all the occurrences of variables with their matching values from the resolver using the given source as a template. The source is not altered by this method.",
        "class": "Substitutes variables within a string by values. This class takes a piece of text and substitutes all the variables within it. The default definition of a variable is {@code ${variableName}}. The prefix and suffix can be changed via constructors and set methods. Variable values are typically resolved from a map, but could also be resolved from system properties, or by supplying a custom variable resolver. The simplest example is to use this class to replace Java System properties. For example:  StrSubstitutor.replaceSystemProperties(\n      \"You are running with java.version = ${java.version} and os.name = ${os.name}.\");\n Typical usage of this class follows the following pattern: First an instance is created and initialized with the map that contains the values for the available variables. If a prefix and\/or suffix for variables should be used other than the default ones, the appropriate settings can be performed. After that the {@code replace()} method can be called passing in the source text for interpolation. In the returned text all variable references (as long as their values are known) will be resolved. The following example demonstrates this:  Map valuesMap = HashMap();\n valuesMap.put(\"animal\", \"quick brown fox\");\n valuesMap.put(\"target\", \"lazy dog\");\n String templateString = \"The ${animal} jumps over the ${target}.\";\n StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(valuesMap);\n String resolvedString = sub.replace(templateString);\n yielding:       The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n Also, this class allows to set a default value for unresolved variables. The default value for a variable can be appended to the variable name after the variable default value delimiter. The default value of the variable default value delimiter is ':-', as in bash and other *nix shells, as those are arguably where the default ${} delimiter set originated. The variable default value delimiter can be manually set by calling {@link #setValueDelimiterMatcher(StrMatcher)}, {@link #setValueDelimiter(char)} or {@link #setValueDelimiter(String)}. The following shows an example with variable default value settings:  Map valuesMap = HashMap();\n valuesMap.put(\"animal\", \"quick brown fox\");\n valuesMap.put(\"target\", \"lazy dog\");\n String templateString = \"The ${animal} jumps over the ${target}. ${undefined.number:-1234567890}.\";\n StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(valuesMap);\n String resolvedString = sub.replace(templateString);\n yielding:       The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 1234567890.\n In addition to this usage pattern there are some static convenience methods that cover the most common use cases. These methods can be used without the need of manually creating an instance. However if multiple replace operations are to be performed, creating and reusing an instance of this class will be more efficient. Variable replacement works in a recursive way. Thus, if a variable value contains a variable then that variable will also be replaced. Cyclic replacements are detected and will cause an exception to be thrown. Sometimes the interpolation's result must contain a variable prefix. As an example take the following source text:    The variable ${${name}} must be used.\n Here only the variable's name referred to in the text should be replaced resulting in the text (assuming that the value of the {@code name} variable is {@code x}):    The variable ${x} must be used.\n To achieve this effect there are two possibilities: Either set a different prefix and suffix for variables which do not conflict with the result text you want to produce. The other possibility is to use the escape character, by default '$'. If this character is placed before a variable reference, this reference is ignored and won't be replaced. For example:    The variable $${${name}} must be used.\n In some complex scenarios you might even want to perform substitution in the names of variables, for instance  ${jre-${java.specification.version}}\n {@code StrSubstitutor} supports this recursive substitution in variable names, but it has to be enabled explicitly by setting the {@link #setEnableSubstitutionInVariables(boolean) enableSubstitutionInVariables} property to true. This class is not thread safe."

        "class": "An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames. User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent pathname strings to name files and directories. This class presents an abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An abstract pathname has two components: An optional system-dependent prefix string, such as a disk-drive specifier, \"\/\" for the UNIX root directory, or \"\\\\\\\\\" for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and A sequence of zero or more string names. The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname. Each subsequent name in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote either a directory or a file. The empty abstract pathname has no prefix and an empty name sequence. The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of the default separator character. The default name-separator character is defined by the system property file.separator, and is made available in the public static fields {@link #separator} and {@link #separatorChar} of this class. When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system. A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either absolute or relative. An absolute pathname is complete in that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it denotes. A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of information taken from some other pathname. By default the classes in the java.io package always resolve relative pathnames against the current user directory. This directory is named by the system property user.dir, and is typically the directory in which the Java virtual machine was invoked. The parent of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking the {@link #getParent} method of this class and consists of the pathname's prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last. Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any File object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's absolute pathname. For example, the directory denoted by the abstract pathname \"\/usr\" is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the pathname \"\/usr\/local\/bin\". The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms, and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms, as follows: For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always \"\/\". Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname denoting the root directory has the prefix \"\/\" and an empty name sequence. For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive specifier consists of the drive letter followed by \":\" and possibly followed by \"\\\\\" if the pathname is absolute. The prefix of a UNC pathname is \"\\\\\\\\\"; the hostname and the share name are the first two names in the name sequence. A relative pathname that does not specify a drive has no prefix. Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system object such as a file or a directory. If it does denote such an object then that object resides in a partition. A partition is an operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system. A single storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may contain multiple partitions. The object, if any, will reside on the partition named by some ancestor of the absolute form of this pathname. A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing. These restrictions are collectively known as access permissions. The file system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object. For example, one set may apply to the object's owner, and another may apply to all other users. The access permissions on an object may cause some methods in this class to fail. Instances of the File class are immutable; that is, once created, the abstract pathname represented by a File object will never change. Interoperability with {@code java.nio.file} package The {@code java.nio.file} package defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access files, file attributes, and file systems. This API may be used to overcome many of the limitations of the {@code java.io.File} class. The {@link #toPath toPath} method may be used to obtain a {@link Path} that uses the abstract path represented by a {@code File} object to locate a file. The resulting {@code Path} may be used with the {@link java.nio.file.Files} class to provide more efficient and extensive access to additional file operations, file attributes, and I\/O exceptions to help diagnose errors when an operation on a file fails."

        "method": "Perform the authentication. This method invokes the {@code login} method for each LoginModule configured for the name specified to the {@code LoginContext} constructor, as determined by the login {@code Configuration}. Each {@code LoginModule} then performs its respective type of authentication (username\/password, smart card pin verification, etc.). This method completes a 2-phase authentication process by calling each configured LoginModule's {@code commit} method if the overall authentication succeeded (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT, and OPTIONAL LoginModules succeeded), or by calling each configured LoginModule's {@code abort} method if the overall authentication failed. If authentication succeeded, each successful LoginModule's {@code commit} method associates the relevant Principals and Credentials with the {@code Subject}. If authentication failed, each LoginModule's {@code abort} method removes\/destroys any previously stored state. If the {@code commit} phase of the authentication process fails, then the overall authentication fails and this method invokes the {@code abort} method for each configured {@code LoginModule}. If the {@code abort} phase fails for any reason, then this method propagates the original exception thrown either during the {@code login} phase or the {@code commit} phase. In either case, the overall authentication fails. In the case where multiple LoginModules fail, this method propagates the exception raised by the first {@code LoginModule} which failed. Note that if this method enters the {@code abort} phase (either the {@code login} or {@code commit} phase failed), this method invokes all LoginModules configured for the application regardless of their respective {@code Configuration} flag parameters. Essentially this means that {@code Requisite} and {@code Sufficient} semantics are ignored during the {@code abort} phase. This guarantees that proper cleanup and state restoration can take place.",
        "class": "The {@code LoginContext} class describes the basic methods used to authenticate Subjects and provides a way to develop an application independent of the underlying authentication technology. A {@code Configuration} specifies the authentication technology, or {@code LoginModule}, to be used with a particular application. Different LoginModules can be plugged in under an application without requiring any modifications to the application itself. In addition to supporting pluggable authentication, this class also supports the notion of stacked authentication. Applications may be configured to use more than one LoginModule. For example, one could configure both a Kerberos LoginModule and a smart card LoginModule under an application. A typical caller instantiates a LoginContext with a name and a {@code CallbackHandler}. LoginContext uses the name as the index into a Configuration to determine which LoginModules should be used, and which ones must succeed in order for the overall authentication to succeed. The {@code CallbackHandler} is passed to the underlying LoginModules so they may communicate and interact with users (prompting for a username and password via a graphical user interface, for example). Once the caller has instantiated a LoginContext, it invokes the {@code login} method to authenticate a {@code Subject}. The {@code login} method invokes the configured modules to perform their respective types of authentication (username\/password, smart card pin verification, etc.). Note that the LoginModules will not attempt authentication retries nor introduce delays if the authentication fails. Such tasks belong to the LoginContext caller. If the {@code login} method returns without throwing an exception, then the overall authentication succeeded. The caller can then retrieve the newly authenticated Subject by invoking the {@code getSubject} method. Principals and Credentials associated with the Subject may be retrieved by invoking the Subject's respective {@code getPrincipals}, {@code getPublicCredentials}, and {@code getPrivateCredentials} methods. To logout the Subject, the caller calls the {@code logout} method. As with the {@code login} method, this {@code logout} method invokes the {@code logout} method for the configured modules. A LoginContext should not be used to authenticate more than one Subject. A separate LoginContext should be used to authenticate each different Subject. The following documentation applies to all LoginContext constructors: {@code Subject} If the constructor has a Subject input parameter, the LoginContext uses the caller-specified Subject object. If the caller specifies a {@code null} Subject and a {@code null} value is permitted, the LoginContext instantiates a new Subject. If the constructor does not have a Subject input parameter, the LoginContext instantiates a new Subject. {@code Configuration} If the constructor has a Configuration input parameter and the caller specifies a non-null Configuration, the LoginContext uses the caller-specified Configuration. If the constructor does not have a Configuration input parameter, or if the caller specifies a {@code null} Configuration object, the constructor uses the following call to get the installed Configuration:       config = Configuration.getConfiguration();\n For both cases, the name argument given to the constructor is passed to the {@code Configuration.getAppConfigurationEntry} method. If the Configuration has no entries for the specified name, then the {@code LoginContext} calls {@code getAppConfigurationEntry} with the name, \"other\" (the default entry name). If there is no entry for \"other\", then a {@code LoginException} is thrown. When LoginContext uses the installed Configuration, the caller requires the createLoginContext.name and possibly createLoginContext.other AuthPermissions. Furthermore, the LoginContext will invoke configured modules from within an {@code AccessController.doPrivileged} call so that modules that perform security-sensitive tasks (such as connecting to remote hosts, and updating the Subject) will require the respective permissions, but the callers of the LoginContext will not require those permissions. When LoginContext uses a caller-specified Configuration, the caller does not require any createLoginContext AuthPermission. The LoginContext saves the {@code AccessControlContext} for the caller, and invokes the configured modules from within an {@code AccessController.doPrivileged} call constrained by that context. This means the caller context (stored when the LoginContext was created) must have sufficient permissions to perform any security-sensitive tasks that the modules may perform. {@code CallbackHandler} If the constructor has a CallbackHandler input parameter, the LoginContext uses the caller-specified CallbackHandler object. If the constructor does not have a CallbackHandler input parameter, or if the caller specifies a {@code null} CallbackHandler object (and a {@code null} value is permitted), the LoginContext queries the {@code auth.login.defaultCallbackHandler} security property for the fully qualified class name of a default handler implementation. If the security property is not set, then the underlying modules will not have a CallbackHandler for use in communicating with users. The caller thus assumes that the configured modules have alternative means for authenticating the user. When the LoginContext uses the installed Configuration (instead of a caller-specified Configuration, see above), then this LoginContext must wrap any caller-specified or default CallbackHandler implementation in a new CallbackHandler implementation whose {@code handle} method implementation invokes the specified CallbackHandler's {@code handle} method in a {@code java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged} call constrained by the caller's current {@code AccessControlContext}."

Because {@code Properties} inherits from {@code Hashtable}, the {@code put} and {@code putAll} methods can be applied to a {@code Properties} object. Their use is strongly discouraged as they allow the caller to insert entries whose keys or values are not {@code Strings}. The {@code setProperty} method should be used instead. If the {@code store} or {@code save} method is called on a \"compromised\" {@code Properties} object that contains a non-{@code String} key or value, the call will fail.

The native2ascii tool can be used to convert property files to and from other character encodings. The {@link #loadFromXML(InputStream)} and {@link #storeToXML(OutputStream, String, String)} methods load and store properties in a simple XML format. By default the UTF-8 character encoding is used, however a specific encoding may be specified if required. Implementations are required to support UTF-8 and UTF-16 and may support other encodings. An XML properties document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:  \n Note that the system URI (http:\/\/java.sun.com\/dtd\/properties.dtd) is not accessed when exporting or importing properties; it merely serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:     \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single Properties object without the need for external synchronization."

The thread does not lose ownership of any monitors.",
        "class": "A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently. Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in some thread creates a new Thread object, the new thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the creating thread is a daemon. When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named main of some designated class). The Java Virtual Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following occurs: The exit method of class Runtime has been called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation to take place. All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by returning from the call to the run method or by throwing an exception that propagates beyond the run method. There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to declare a class to be a subclass of Thread. This subclass should override the run method of class Thread. An instance of the subclass can then be allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes larger than a stated value could be written as follows:      class PrimeThread extends Thread {\n         long minPrime;\n         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {\n             this.minPrime = minPrime;\n         }\n\n         public void run() {\n             \/\/ compute primes larger than minPrime\n              . . .\n         }\n     }\n The following code would then create a thread and start it running:      PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);\n     p.start();\n The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that implements the Runnable interface. That class then implements the run method. An instance of the class can then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating Thread, and started. The same example in this other style looks like the following:      class PrimeRun implements Runnable {\n         long minPrime;\n         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {\n             this.minPrime = minPrime;\n         }\n\n         public void run() {\n             \/\/ compute primes larger than minPrime\n              . . .\n         }\n     }\n The following code would then create a thread and start it running:      PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);\n     new Thread(p).start();\n Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when a thread is created, a new name is generated for it. Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown."

        "method": "Log a LogRecord. All the other logging methods in this class call through this method to actually perform any logging. Subclasses can override this single method to capture all log activity.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

A cookie's value can uniquely identify a client, so cookies are commonly used for session management. A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them. HTTP 1.0 does not cache pages that use cookies created with this class. This class does not support the cache control defined with HTTP 1.1. This class supports both the Version 0 (by Netscape) and Version 1 (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications. By default, cookies are created using Version 0 to ensure the best interoperability."

A common misconception in using this implementation is that an EIS resource (RDBMS, etc) would be \"hit\" every time a method is called. This is not necessarily the case and is up to the implementation of the underlying {@code SecurityManager} instance. If caching of authorization data is desired (to eliminate EIS round trips and therefore improve database performance), it is considered much more elegant to let the underlying {@code SecurityManager} implementation or its delegate components manage caching, not this class.

The interpretation of filterExpr is based on RFC 2254. It may additionally contain variables of the form {i} -- where i is an integer -- that refer to objects in the filterArgs array. The interpretation of filterExpr is otherwise identical to that of the filter parameter of the method search(Name, String, SearchControls). When a variable {i} appears in a search filter, it indicates that the filter argument filterArgs[i] is to be used in that place. Such variables may be used wherever an attr, value, or matchingrule production appears in the filter grammar of RFC 2254, section 4. When a string-valued filter argument is substituted for a variable, the filter is interpreted as if the string were given in place of the variable, with any characters having special significance within filters (such as '*') having been escaped according to the rules of RFC 2254. For directories that do not use a string representation for some or all of their attributes, the filter argument corresponding to an attribute value may be of a type other than String. Directories that support unstructured binary-valued attributes, for example, should accept byte arrays as filter arguments. The interpretation (if any) of filter arguments of any other type is determined by the service provider for that directory, which maps the filter operations onto operations with corresponding semantics in the underlying directory. This method returns an enumeration of the results. Each element in the enumeration contains the name of the object and other information about the object (see SearchResult). The name is either relative to the target context of the search (which is named by the name parameter), or it is a URL string. If the target context is included in the enumeration (as is possible when cons specifies a search scope of SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE or SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE), its name is the empty string. The SearchResult may also contain attributes of the matching object if the cons argument specifies that attributes be returned. If the object does not have a requested attribute, that nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested attributes that the object does have will be returned. A directory might return more attributes than were requested (see Attribute Type Names in the class description) but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes. If a search filter with invalid variable substitutions is provided to this method, the result is undefined.

This AuthenticationProvider is capable of validating {@link org.springframework.security.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken} requests contain the correct username and password. This implementation is backed by a JAAS configuration. The loginConfig property must be set to a given JAAS configuration file. This setter accepts a Spring {@link org.springframework.core.io.Resource} instance. It should point to a JAAS configuration file containing an index matching the {@link #setLoginContextName(java.lang.String) loginContextName} property. For example: If this JaasAuthenticationProvider were configured in a Spring WebApplicationContext the xml to set the loginConfiguration could be as follows...  \n   \/WEB-INF\/login.conf\n \n The loginContextName should coincide with a given index in the loginConfig specifed. The loginConfig file used in the JUnit tests appears as the following...  JAASTest {\n   org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.TestLoginModule required;\n };\n Using the example login configuration above, the loginContextName property would be set as JAASTest...    JAASTest \n When using JAAS login modules as the authentication source, sometimes the LoginContext will require CallbackHandlers. The JaasAuthenticationProvider uses an internal CallbackHandler to wrap the {@link JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler}s configured in the ApplicationContext. When the LoginContext calls the internal CallbackHandler, control is passed to each {@link JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler} for each Callback passed. {@link JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler}s are passed to the JaasAuthenticationProvider through the {@link #setCallbackHandlers(org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler[]) callbackHandlers} property.  \n   \n     \n     \n     \n  \n \n After calling LoginContext.login(), the JaasAuthenticationProvider will retrieve the returned Principals from the Subject (LoginContext.getSubject().getPrincipals). Each returned principal is then passed to the configured {@link AuthorityGranter}s. An AuthorityGranter is a mapping between a returned Principal, and a role name. If an AuthorityGranter wishes to grant an Authorization a role, it returns that role name from it's {@link AuthorityGranter#grant(java.security.Principal)} method. The returned role will be applied to the Authorization object as a {@link GrantedAuthority}. AuthorityGranters are configured in spring xml as follows...  \n   \n     \n   \n  \n A configuration note: The JaasAuthenticationProvider uses the security properites &quote;login.config.url.X&quote; to configure jaas. If you would like to customize the way Jaas gets configured, create a subclass of this and override the {@link #configureJaas(Resource)} method."

The {@link #loadFromXML(InputStream)} and {@link #storeToXML(OutputStream, String, String)} methods load and store properties in a simple XML format. By default the UTF-8 character encoding is used, however a specific encoding may be specified if required. Implementations are required to support UTF-8 and UTF-16 and may support other encodings.

        "method": "Canonicalization is simply the operation of reducing a possibly encoded string down to its simplest form. This is important, because attackers frequently use encoding to change their input in a way that will bypass validation filters, but still be interpreted properly by the target of the attack. Note that data encoded more than once is not something that a normal user would generate and should be regarded as an attack. Everyone says you shouldn't do validation without canonicalizing the data first. This is easier said than done. The canonicalize method can be used to simplify just about any input down to its most basic form. Note that canonicalize doesn't handle Unicode issues, it focuses on higher level encoding and escaping schemes. In addition to simple decoding, canonicalize also handles: Perverse but legal variants of escaping schemes Multiple escaping (%2526 or &lt;) Mixed escaping (%26lt;) Nested escaping (%%316 or &%6ct;) All combinations of multiple, mixed, and nested encoding\/escaping (%253c or ┦gt;) Using canonicalize is simple. The default is just...\n                    String clean = ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize( request.getParameter(\"input\"));\n                    You need to decode untrusted data so that it's safe for ANY downstream interpreter or decoder. For example, if your data goes into a Windows command shell, then into a database, and then to a browser, you're going to need to decode for all of those systems. You can build a custom encoder to canonicalize for your application like this...\n                    ArrayList list = new ArrayList();\n                    list.add( new WindowsCodec() );\n                    list.add( new MySQLCodec() );\n                    list.add( new PercentCodec() );\n                    Encoder encoder = new DefaultEncoder( list );\n                    String clean = encoder.canonicalize( request.getParameter( \"input\" ));\n                    In ESAPI, the Validator uses the canonicalize method before it does validation. So all you need to do is to validate as normal and you'll be protected against a host of encoded attacks.      String input = request.getParameter( \"name\" );\n                    String name = ESAPI.validator().isValidInput( \"test\", input, \"FirstName\", 20, false);\n                    However, the default canonicalize() method only decodes HTMLEntity, percent (URL) encoding, and JavaScript encoding. If you'd like to use a custom canonicalizer with your validator, that's pretty easy too.\n                    ... setup custom encoder as above\n                    Validator validator = new DefaultValidator( encoder );\n                    String input = request.getParameter( \"name\" );\n                    String name = validator.isValidInput( \"test\", input, \"name\", 20, false);\n                    Although ESAPI is able to canonicalize multiple, mixed, or nested encoding, it's safer to not accept this stuff in the first place. In ESAPI, the default is \"strict\" mode that throws an IntrusionException if it receives anything not single-encoded with a single scheme. Currently this is not configurable in ESAPI.properties, but it probably should be. Even if you disable \"strict\" mode, you'll still get warning messages in the log about each multiple encoding and mixed encoding received.      \/\/ disabling strict mode to allow mixed encoding\n                    String url = ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize( request.getParameter(\"url\"), false);",

        "method": "Returns the selected text contained in this TextComponent. If the selection is null or the document empty, returns null.",
        "class": "JTextComponent is the base class for swing text components. It tries to be compatible with the java.awt.TextComponent class where it can reasonably do so. Also provided are other services for additional flexibility (beyond the pluggable UI and bean support). You can find information on how to use the functionality this class provides in General Rules for Using Text Components, a section in The Java Tutorial. Caret Changes The caret is a pluggable object in swing text components. Notification of changes to the caret position and the selection are sent to implementations of the CaretListener interface that have been registered with the text component. The UI will install a default caret unless a customized caret has been set. By default the caret tracks all the document changes performed on the Event Dispatching Thread and updates it's position accordingly if an insertion occurs before or at the caret position or a removal occurs before the caret position. DefaultCaret tries to make itself visible which may lead to scrolling of a text component within JScrollPane. The default caret behavior can be changed by the {@link DefaultCaret#setUpdatePolicy} method. Note: Non-editable text components also have a caret though it may not be painted. Commands Text components provide a number of commands that can be used to manipulate the component. This is essentially the way that the component expresses its capabilities. These are expressed in terms of the swing Action interface, using the TextAction implementation. The set of commands supported by the text component can be found with the {@link #getActions} method. These actions can be bound to key events, fired from buttons, etc. Text Input The text components support flexible and internationalized text input, using keymaps and the input method framework, while maintaining compatibility with the AWT listener model. A {@link javax.swing.text.Keymap} lets an application bind key strokes to actions. In order to allow keymaps to be shared across multiple text components, they can use actions that extend TextAction. TextAction can determine which JTextComponent most recently has or had focus and therefore is the subject of the action (In the case that the ActionEvent sent to the action doesn't contain the target text component as its source). The input method framework lets text components interact with input methods, separate software components that preprocess events to let users enter thousands of different characters using keyboards with far fewer keys. JTextComponent is an active client of the framework, so it implements the preferred user interface for interacting with input methods. As a consequence, some key events do not reach the text component because they are handled by an input method, and some text input reaches the text component as committed text within an {@link java.awt.event.InputMethodEvent} instead of as a key event. The complete text input is the combination of the characters in keyTyped key events and committed text in input method events. The AWT listener model lets applications attach event listeners to components in order to bind events to actions. Swing encourages the use of keymaps instead of listeners, but maintains compatibility with listeners by giving the listeners a chance to steal an event by consuming it. Keyboard event and input method events are handled in the following stages, with each stage capable of consuming the event: Stage KeyEvent InputMethodEvent 1. input methods (generated here) 2. focus manager 3. registered key listeners registered input method listeners 4. input method handling in JTextComponent 5. keymap handling using the current keymap 6. keyboard handling in JComponent (e.g. accelerators, component navigation, etc.) To maintain compatibility with applications that listen to key events but are not aware of input method events, the input method handling in stage 4 provides a compatibility mode for components that do not process input method events. For these components, the committed text is converted to keyTyped key events and processed in the key event pipeline starting at stage 3 instead of in the input method event pipeline. By default the component will create a keymap (named DEFAULT_KEYMAP) that is shared by all JTextComponent instances as the default keymap. Typically a look-and-feel implementation will install a different keymap that resolves to the default keymap for those bindings not found in the different keymap. The minimal bindings include: inserting content into the editor for the printable keys. removing content with the backspace and del keys. caret movement forward and backward Model\/View Split The text components have a model-view split. A text component pulls together the objects used to represent the model, view, and controller. The text document model may be shared by other views which act as observers of the model (e.g. a document may be shared by multiple components). The model is defined by the {@link Document} interface. This is intended to provide a flexible text storage mechanism that tracks change during edits and can be extended to more sophisticated models. The model interfaces are meant to capture the capabilities of expression given by SGML, a system used to express a wide variety of content. Each modification to the document causes notification of the details of the change to be sent to all observers in the form of a {@link DocumentEvent} which allows the views to stay up to date with the model. This event is sent to observers that have implemented the {@link DocumentListener} interface and registered interest with the model being observed. Location Information The capability of determining the location of text in the view is provided. There are two methods, {@link #modelToView} and {@link #viewToModel} for determining this information. Undo\/Redo support Support for an edit history mechanism is provided to allow undo\/redo operations. The text component does not itself provide the history buffer by default, but does provide the UndoableEdit records that can be used in conjunction with a history buffer to provide the undo\/redo support. The support is provided by the Document model, which allows one to attach UndoableEditListener implementations. Thread Safety The swing text components provide some support of thread safe operations. Because of the high level of configurability of the text components, it is possible to circumvent the protection provided. The protection primarily comes from the model, so the documentation of AbstractDocument describes the assumptions of the protection provided. The methods that are safe to call asynchronously are marked with comments. Newlines For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see DefaultEditorKit. Printing support Several {@link #print print} methods are provided for basic document printing. If more advanced printing is needed, use the {@link #getPrintable} method. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeans™ has been added to the java.beans package. Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}."

Not all platforms use the newline character ('\\n') to terminate lines. Calling this method to terminate each output line is therefore preferred to writing a newline character directly. In general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying character or byte stream. Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters. For example,  PrintWriter out\n   = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(\"foo.out\")));\n will buffer the PrintWriter's output to the file. Without buffering, each invocation of a print() method would cause characters to be converted into bytes that would then be written immediately to the file, which can be very inefficient."

Only the specified portion of the buffer will be processed. The rest of the buffer is not processed, and is not returned.",
        "class": "Substitutes variables within a string by values. This class takes a piece of text and substitutes all the variables within it. The default definition of a variable is {@code ${variableName}}. The prefix and suffix can be changed via constructors and set methods. Variable values are typically resolved from a map, but could also be resolved from system properties, or by supplying a custom variable resolver. The simplest example is to use this class to replace Java System properties. For example:  StrSubstitutor.replaceSystemProperties(\n      \"You are running with java.version = ${java.version} and os.name = ${os.name}.\");\n Typical usage of this class follows the following pattern: First an instance is created and initialized with the map that contains the values for the available variables. If a prefix and\/or suffix for variables should be used other than the default ones, the appropriate settings can be performed. After that the {@code replace()} method can be called passing in the source text for interpolation. In the returned text all variable references (as long as their values are known) will be resolved. The following example demonstrates this:  Map valuesMap = HashMap();\n valuesMap.put(\"animal\", \"quick brown fox\");\n valuesMap.put(\"target\", \"lazy dog\");\n String templateString = \"The ${animal} jumps over the ${target}.\";\n StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(valuesMap);\n String resolvedString = sub.replace(templateString);\n yielding:       The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n Also, this class allows to set a default value for unresolved variables. The default value for a variable can be appended to the variable name after the variable default value delimiter. The default value of the variable default value delimiter is ':-', as in bash and other *nix shells, as those are arguably where the default ${} delimiter set originated. The variable default value delimiter can be manually set by calling {@link #setValueDelimiterMatcher(StrMatcher)}, {@link #setValueDelimiter(char)} or {@link #setValueDelimiter(String)}. The following shows an example with variable default value settings:  Map valuesMap = HashMap();\n valuesMap.put(\"animal\", \"quick brown fox\");\n valuesMap.put(\"target\", \"lazy dog\");\n String templateString = \"The ${animal} jumps over the ${target}. ${undefined.number:-1234567890}.\";\n StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(valuesMap);\n String resolvedString = sub.replace(templateString);\n yielding:       The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 1234567890.\n In addition to this usage pattern there are some static convenience methods that cover the most common use cases. These methods can be used without the need of manually creating an instance. However if multiple replace operations are to be performed, creating and reusing an instance of this class will be more efficient. Variable replacement works in a recursive way. Thus, if a variable value contains a variable then that variable will also be replaced. Cyclic replacements are detected and will cause an exception to be thrown. Sometimes the interpolation's result must contain a variable prefix. As an example take the following source text:    The variable ${${name}} must be used.\n Here only the variable's name referred to in the text should be replaced resulting in the text (assuming that the value of the {@code name} variable is {@code x}):    The variable ${x} must be used.\n To achieve this effect there are two possibilities: Either set a different prefix and suffix for variables which do not conflict with the result text you want to produce. The other possibility is to use the escape character, by default '$'. If this character is placed before a variable reference, this reference is ignored and won't be replaced. For example:    The variable $${${name}} must be used.\n In some complex scenarios you might even want to perform substitution in the names of variables, for instance  ${jre-${java.specification.version}}\n {@code StrSubstitutor} supports this recursive substitution in variable names, but it has to be enabled explicitly by setting the {@link #setEnableSubstitutionInVariables(boolean) enableSubstitutionInVariables} property to true. This class is not thread safe."

        "class": "An advanced hash table supporting configurable garbage collection semantics of keys and values, optional referential-equality, full concurrency of retrievals, and adjustable expected concurrency for updates. This table is designed around specific advanced use-cases. If there is any doubt whether this table is for you, you most likely should be using {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} instead. This table supports strong, weak, and soft keys and values. By default keys are weak, and values are strong. Such a configuration offers similar behavior to {@link java.util.WeakHashMap}, entries of this table are periodically removed once their corresponding keys are no longer referenced outside of this table. In other words, this table will not prevent a key from being discarded by the garbage collector. Once a key has been discarded by the collector, the corresponding entry is no longer visible to this table; however, the entry may occupy space until a future table operation decides to reclaim it. For this reason, summary functions such as {@code size} and {@code isEmpty} might return a value greater than the observed number of entries. In order to support a high level of concurrency, stale entries are only reclaimed during blocking (usually mutating) operations. Enabling soft keys allows entries in this table to remain until their space is absolutely needed by the garbage collector. This is unlike weak keys which can be reclaimed as soon as they are no longer referenced by a normal strong reference. The primary use case for soft keys is a cache, which ideally occupies memory that is not in use for as long as possible. By default, values are held using a normal strong reference. This provides the commonly desired guarantee that a value will always have at least the same life-span as it's key. For this reason, care should be taken to ensure that a value never refers, either directly or indirectly, to its key, thereby preventing reclamation. If this is unavoidable, then it is recommended to use the same reference type in use for the key. However, it should be noted that non-strong values may disappear before their corresponding key. While this table does allow the use of both strong keys and values, it is recommended to use {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} for such a configuration, since it is optimized for that case. Just like {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap}, this class obeys the same functional specification as {@link java.util.Hashtable}, and includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of {@code Hashtable}. However, even though all operations are thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking, and there is not any support for locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access. This class is fully interoperable with {@code Hashtable} in programs that rely on its thread safety but not on its synchronization details. Retrieval operations (including {@code get}) generally do not block, so may overlap with update operations (including {@code put} and {@code remove}). Retrievals reflect the results of the most recently completed update operations holding upon their onset. For aggregate operations such as {@code putAll} and {@code clear}, concurrent retrievals may reflect insertion or removal of only some entries. Similarly, Iterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the state of the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the iterator\/enumeration. They do not throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}. However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time. The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by the optional {@code concurrencyLevel} constructor argument (default {@code 16}), which is used as a hint for internal sizing. The table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention. Because placement in hash tables is essentially random, the actual concurrency will vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one is appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and all others will only read. Also, resizing this or any other kind of hash table is a relatively slow operation, so, when possible, it is a good idea to provide estimates of expected table sizes in constructors. This class and its views and iterators implement all of the optional methods of the {@link Map} and {@link Iterator} interfaces.

A new {@link FileDescriptor} object is created to represent this file connection. The mode argument specifies the access mode in which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their meanings are: Value Meaning \"r\" Open for reading only. Invoking any of the write methods of the resulting object will cause an {@link java.io.IOException} to be thrown. \"rw\" Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already exist then an attempt will be made to create it. \"rws\" Open for reading and writing, as with \"rw\", and also require that every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. \"rwd\" Open for reading and writing, as with \"rw\", and also require that every update to the file's content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. The \"rws\" and \"rwd\" modes work much like the {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel#force(boolean) force(boolean)} method of the {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel} class, passing arguments of true and false, respectively, except that they always apply to every I\/O operation and are therefore often more efficient. If the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file by that invocation will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash. If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee is made. The \"rwd\" mode can be used to reduce the number of I\/O operations performed. Using \"rwd\" only requires updates to the file's content to be written to storage; using \"rws\" requires updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which generally requires at least one more low-level I\/O operation. If there is a security manager, its {@code checkRead} method is called with the pathname of the {@code file} argument as its argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode allows writing, the security manager's {@code checkWrite} method is also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is allowed.",
        "class": "Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor, or index into the implied array, called the file pointer; input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is created in read\/write mode, then output operations are also available; output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be extended. The file pointer can be read by the {@code getFilePointer} method and set by the {@code seek} method. It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been read, an {@code EOFException} (which is a kind of {@code IOException}) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for any reason other than end-of-file, an {@code IOException} other than {@code EOFException} is thrown. In particular, an {@code IOException} may be thrown if the stream has been closed."

A cookie's value can uniquely identify a client, so cookies are commonly used for session management. A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them. HTTP 1.0 does not cache pages that use cookies created with this class. This class does not support the cache control defined with HTTP 1.1. This class supports both the Version 0 (by Netscape) and Version 1 (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications. By default, cookies are created using Version 0 to ensure the best interoperability."

        "method": "Log a SEVERE message. If the logger is currently enabled for the SEVERE message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects.",
        "class": "A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create \"anonymous\" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a \"parent\" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a \"Level\" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a {@code ResourceBundle} associated with it. The {@code ResourceBundle} may be specified by name, using the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)} factory method, or by value - using the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method. This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name, then it will inherit the {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a \"msg\" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization {@code ResourceBundle} and if the {@code ResourceBundle} has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string \"{0} {1}\" would format two parameters as strings. A set of methods alternatively take a \"msgSupplier\" instead of a \"msg\" argument. These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code } function which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version, the code would look like: \n\n   class DiagnosisMessages {\n     static String systemHealthStatus() {\n       \/\/ collect system health information\n       ...\n     }\n   }\n   ...\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());\n With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is enabled. \n\n   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);\n When looking for a {@code ResourceBundle}, the logger will first look at whether a bundle was specified using {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle}, and then only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. If no {@code ResourceBundle} or no resource bundle name is found, then it will use the nearest {@code ResourceBundle} or resource bundle name inherited from its parent tree. When a {@code ResourceBundle} was inherited or specified through the {@link #setResourceBundle(java.util.ResourceBundle) setResourceBundle} method, then that {@code ResourceBundle} will be used. Otherwise if the logger only has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name will be mapped to a {@code ResourceBundle} object, using the default Locale at the time of logging. When mapping resource bundle names to {@code ResourceBundle} objects, the logger will first try to use the Thread's {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader} to map the given resource bundle name to a {@code ResourceBundle}. If the thread context class loader is {@code null}, it will try the {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} instead. If the {@code ResourceBundle} is still not found, it will use the class loader of the first caller of the {@link #getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) getLogger} factory method. Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of \"log\" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of \"logp\" methods (for \"log precise\") that are like the \"log\" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of \"logrb\" method (for \"log with resource bundle\") that are like the \"logp\" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle object for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the \"entering\" methods), method returns (the \"exiting\" methods) and throwing exceptions (the \"throwing\" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names (\"severe\", \"warning\", \"info\", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a \"best effort\" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as \"isLoggable\" and \"log(LogRecord)\" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method."

A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number. Some Web browsers have bugs in how they handle the optional attributes, so use them sparingly to improve the interoperability of your servlets. The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie} method, which adds fields to HTTP response headers to send cookies to the browser, one at a time. The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each. The browser returns cookies to the servlet by adding fields to HTTP request headers. Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the {@link HttpServletRequest#getCookies} method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes. Cookies affect the caching of the Web pages that use them. HTTP 1.0 does not cache pages that use cookies created with this class. This class does not support the cache control defined with HTTP 1.1. This class supports both the Version 0 (by Netscape) and Version 1 (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications. By default, cookies are created using Version 0 to ensure the best interoperability."
